Pythagore is an IRC bot initially aimed at giving functionality such as a 
quote database, channel statistics et al. to users of the Teepi IRC 
Network <irc.teepi.net>.

Pythagore is written in Python using the twisted framework for network
interaction, PyYAML to store modules' configuration, and SQLAlchemy for
the channels and quotes database. It is licensed under the GNU General
Public License (or GPL) version 2 (see LICENSE for details).

Running Pythagore :

It's quite easy: edit configuration files to fit your needs in the Config/
subdirectory (it should be YAML files), and then run Pythagore.py to
launch the bot.
