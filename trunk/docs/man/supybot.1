.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Supybot
is a robust, user-friendly, and programmer-friendly Python IRC bot.
It aims to be an adequate replacement for most existing IRC bots.  It
includes a very flexible and powerful ACL system for controlling access
to commands, as well as more than 50 builtin plugins providing around
400 actual commands.
